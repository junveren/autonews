Overview
This tool is an AI-powered news monitoring dashboard built to track sentiment, earnings, and product-related news for key automotive accounts in the Americas. It runs daily in a Google Colab virtual machine, scrapes the latest headlines using RSS and GNews, analyzes sentiment with VADER, summarizes articles using Hugging Face's transformer model, and visualizes insights in a clean HTML dashboard hosted on GitHub Pages â€” all at zero cost. The tool highlights trending companies, tracks key product keywords (e.g. Android Auto, Snapdragon), and archives both HTML and CSV logs to monitor shifts in market perception over time.
